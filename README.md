Task Description:
Predicting Amazon product reviews' rating.
Users can rate product on Amazon from 1 to 5 stars. The 5-star reviews contain many instances of "Great", "Good" and so on. On the other hand, the 1-star reviews use very little positive words and frequently contain warnings for potential customers. 
Create a model to predict the rating of the product based on the customer review.
